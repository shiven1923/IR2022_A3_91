Link Analysis, PageRank, Hubs and Authorities  
  
The Network is taken from Wiki-Vote.txt from : https://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-Vote.html  

Link Analysis  
1. Number of Nodes = 7115
2. Number of Edges = 103689
3. Average In-Degree = 14.573295853829936  
Formula Used = Sum(In-Degree of all Nodes)/(Number of Nodes)
4. Average Out-Degree = 14.573295853829936  
Formula Used = Sum(Out-Degree of all Nodes)/(Number of Nodes)
5. Node having Maximum In Degree = Node ID 4037
6. Node having Maximum Out Degree = Node ID 2565
7. Network Density = 0.0020485375110809584  
Formula Used = (Number of Edges)/(7115 x 7114)

(IN/OUT) Degree Distribution in the Q.ipynb file  
X-Axis : (IN/OUT) Degree  
Y-Axis : (Frequency of (IN/OUT) Degree)/(Number of Nodes)  

Local Clustering Coefficient in the Q.ipynb file  
Formula Used:  
LCC(node i) = (Number of edges in Ni) / (ni * (ni-1))  
where,  
Ni are the neighbouring nodes of node i  
ni is the number of neighbouring nodes of node i
